DISCO:
- Basic CSS review : `text-align` to center/align text, `color` to color text, `background-color` to color background
- Useful CSS properties:
	- `display: inline-block` prevents an automatic new line after tag, allowing for multiple text parts on one line
	-`margin-left: npx` and `margin-right: npx` can change text margins by a specified number of pixels, can be used alongside `inline-block` to format two batches of text on the same line\
	-HTML `footer` tag adds a footer to the bottom of whatever is displayed in the webpage 
	-`float` moves a chunk of text to a specified place (e.g. right, left)
	-In our attempts to handle the oversized textboxes of the footer, we delved a little into resize and overflow.
		-Overflow is how the browser will handle the text that goes out of the textbox
		-If overflow is set to auto (or left at default), then the text spills out of the box vertically.
		-If overflow is set to hidden, the text is cutoff.	
		-If overflow is hidden, the resize attribute can be used to change the size of the textbox.
		-However, there is a difference between a text overflow, and a textbox being resized to accomodate the screen size. So that research was for naught.
QCC:
- Is there a better method than all this trial and error?
